# Hello React! (blank)

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular UI library for building web apps, usually single page apps. [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a powerful tool for building javascript apps that bundles all of your code and shows immediate changes while you're editing. We're big fans!

## What's in this project?

‚Üê `README.md`: That‚Äôs this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

‚Üê `index.html`: This is the main page template React uses to build your site. When you're ready to share it or add a custom domain, change SEO/meta settings in here.

‚Üê `src/`: This folder contains all the files React will use to build your site.

### Working in the `src/` folder üìÅ

‚Üê `src/index.jsx`: This is the root of your React app. If you add libraries like [chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com) or [redux](https://react-redux.js.org), you'll insert their providers here. The `<HelmetProvider`> is an example of a provider you'd use.

‚Üê `src/app.jsx`: The base for your react app, here is where the magic really happens.

‚Üê `src/pages/`: Pages to import to the router should go here!

‚Üê `src/styles`: CSS files add styling rules to your content. You have [a lot of](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css) importing options for CSS including CSS modules if that's your jam.
